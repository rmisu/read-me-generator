# read-me-generator

Description:
This project is a tool that allows users to easily generate professionally structured README files for any project they are working on.

The Table of Contents includes:
-Installation
-Usage
-Credits
-License
-Contributing
-Tests
-Questions

Users will be able to summarize how other developers can utilize their tool as well as indicate other important information such as: 
-Which license the project was created under
-Key contributions
-How others can contibute to the projects
-Where/how to contact the creator about any questions they may have

I know this tool will be useful for me in my future development projects, and I hope it can prove useful for others as well.
