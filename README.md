# read-me-generator

Description:
This project is a tool that allows users to easily generate professionally structured README files for any project they are working on.

The Table of Contents includes:
1) Installation
2) Usage
3) Credits
4) License
5) Contributing
6) Tests
7) Questions

Users will be able to summarize how other developers can utilize their tool as well as indicate other important information such as: 
1) Which license the project was created under
2) Key contributions
3) How others can contibute to the projects
4) Where/how to contact the creator about any questions they may have

I know this tool will be useful for me in my future development projects, and I hope it can prove useful for others as well.
